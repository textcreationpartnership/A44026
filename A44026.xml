         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>he ill favour of dirty ſpirits hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee from imbraceing this clean piece of Truth held forth to thee. The Phraſes are clear, the Matter ſutable, as to the day wherein we live, that though I were ſilent, the Book it ſelf would ſpeak enough for its acceptance.</p>
            <p>Now all my deſire is, that it may be of uſe to thy ſouls health and proſperity of the inward-man: And that it may be ſo, by Heaven's bleſſing, give me leave to give a few words of advice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do not take that with the left hand of prejudice that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb facs="tcp:38218:5"/>to thee with the right hand of true ſincerity and ſingleneſs of heart; Endeavour therefore to put a candid and fair conſtruction, as in charity thou are bound, on his endeavour, who hath nothing more in his eye, than God's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the good of ſouls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beg the leading of God's dear Spirit, which alone ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and diſcovereth the things of God to the Children of men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. and ſo on. Oh it's this Spirit that can unriddle the Divine Myſteries of the Goſpel. Never think to reade this Piece in the worlds wiſdom, for if thou doſt, it will contribute very little to thy ſatisfaction, but rather oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thee to ſtumble at the
<pb facs="tcp:38218:6"/>things written, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. and ſo on to <hi>ver.</hi> 26. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be not offended at the ſhort and brief paſſages through ſome particulars treated of in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider all the Scriptures and Arguments to prove any one point; I ſay, weigh them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and not apart one from the other; for if there be but two or three Texts or Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt five or ten to prove the truth of any one point, that are ſubſtantial and to the purpoſe, it is ſufficient, though the reſt are not ſo ſtrong, or of equal ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Take heed of a heart riſing in pride; for it is the <hi>humble ones</hi> the Lord ſtands engaged by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to teach, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:38218:6"/>
            <p n="6">6. And laſtly, Beg Heavens bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in thy reading of it, and then I queſtion not but it will be of much benefit to thee. Thus having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed theſe few things, I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to trouble thee any further, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begging the Father of Mercies, and God of all Conſolation, to make this following Piece effectuall to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching thy ſoul in the Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God, and a bringing thy heart to a real imbracing of theſe bleſſed Truths of God unfolded in it, and to the accompliſhment of all the good ends for the which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſhall be the conſtant prayer of him, who begs the Exaltation of God's Glory, and Saints Happineſs, above all things.</p>

            <p>THis enſuing Treatiſe being by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor left in a Friends hand at his Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and it coming to the view of ſome that it hath been uſeful to, they thought it worthy to be put in print for a more publick benefit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded it will prove ſo to them that can without prejudice read and conſider of it: 'Tis true, there have been ſo many Cenſures caſt upon him by them that profeſs to fear God, that it may make many, who ſearch no further, but believe Reports coming out of ſuch mouths that they think dare not lie, to believe all is, as they ſay it is; but he that knoweth all things will one day juſtifie him before Men, Angels and Devils: And his Innocency would appear in ſome things already, did perſons believe the ſad ſufferings he is ſtill in; though cenſured to be there, but under a cover to betray ſome in thoſe parts, but prove not what they ſay, or have ſaid, and yet they have from one time to another promiſed to do it; by which means his Name hath been murdered, the Name of Chriſt wounded, and many a poor heart grieved
<pb facs="tcp:38218:7"/>that knows and hath found it ſo, though others cannot or will not yet ſee it: but it hath been no ſmall comfort unto him, and ſome that love him for what they know is of Chriſt in him, to conſider that the moſt precious People of God of old were led in that path; as <hi>Job,</hi> how deep did he drink of that cup? and that by them that pretended moſt high for God, and ſeemed moſt zealous againſt ſin; And <hi>Paul, David,</hi> and others; nay our bleſſed Lord Jeſus, that pure and ſpotleſs Lamb, that did nothing but good, how was he reviled, reproached, ſcorned, and almoſt every action, though it was never ſo much for their good, was turned by them as a charge againſt him? and it was not only by the rude mutitude, but they that profeſſed to walk cloſeſt to God's Will, and were in his outward Inſtitutions: So it's no wonder that ſuch in this day deal ſo with his Servants, that deſire to follow him according to his Will, as bleſſed be God this poor man doth, though it's like he may not in all things walk up to mens cuſtoms, (that in this day is very much a rule of peoples conſciences) but according to the juſt Law of God, to whom he can with <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal for Juſtification; it's He that ſearcheth

            <p>And being it is ſo, we ought not to be too confident of the truth of a Reports, becauſe the Reporter may have fame among ſome men, but let us ſearch and ſee whether it be ſo or no; and not condemn any man before we hear his cauſe, for that is ſo far below a Chriſt-like Spirit, that the <hi>Romans</hi> Law doth not admit of ſuch a thing: therefore let all that look on themſelves to be Saints, that may come to reade this little Piece, be warned to take care that they hear the Accuſed as well as the Accuſer, and weigh things man equal ballance, before they paſs ſentence, leſt by raſh judging, they come under reproof by the juſtneſs of the <hi>Romans</hi> Law.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:38218:8"/>
            <p>And in reading, let not thy eye be upon that dirt which is (though unjuſtly) caſt upon him; if ſo, thou art like to reap but little benefit by it: for God doth uſe to anſwer perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Idols and Imaginations of their hearts: but if thy ſoul be willing to imbrace Truth for the ſake of the Father of Truth, without reſpect or diſreſpect to any mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I queſtion not but what is here preſented to thee by a poor ſuffering cenſured Priſoner, may be found by thee worth the treaſuring up in the Cabinet of thy Experiences, and in a day of ſtraits it may prove of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to thee, as bleſſed be God I can ſay it hath done to my ſoul; and that not only in point of comfort, but in finding out many deceits that attend poor ſouls in this world, and in the may they may think leads only to Heaven; and it will be enough for thoſe ſouls (that through all the deceits, cenſures and ſufferings that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them in this life) that do but arrive at that Haven of Reſt, where is nothing but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in unity to all Eternity, which will make amends for all their ſorrows, though never ſo great.</p>
            <p>But were the Author of this Book as he is
<pb facs="tcp:38218:9"/>rendred, I think it ſhould be the work of thoſe that revile him (were they what they profeſs to be) rather to pity and pray for him, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his Reſtoration, than to do as they do and have done by him: for the puniſhment due to what they charge on him will be ſo great, that any truly gracious heart can do no other but pity one that is like to undergo it, and not envy any happineſs that he hath in this world, nor do what they can to deprive him of it, as ſome have done by him: but I ſhall ſay no more to that, nor no longer detain thee from what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, but leave thee to the guidance of the Spirit of Truth: and if thou and I do but ſo walk that we may be juſtified by God, tis no great matter what men judge of us; which is and ſhall be the deſire of thy Friend, that loves all, but deſireth to delight in none but for their likeneſs to Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

            <head>To all that in Truth fear the Lord, and are faithful Followers of the Lamb; or any other that ſhall reade what I have in this time of my Impriſonment writ.</head>
            <p>BEloved, it is below a Natural Noble Spirit, much more below Grace, to ſtumble or ſtartle at that which muſt be, and what is daily looked for; And leſt my weakneſs in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may uphold others in that way and work, I ſhall forbear to enumerate my unheard-of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Cenſures, and how much my heart, though innocent, was brought down by it, leſt it may be an occaſion of ſome weak ones ſtumbling at the Truth. It is the duty of all and every one of Gods People, eſpecially in this day, to be a <hi>bearer of burdens,</hi> but not a <hi>layer on of burdens</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, and in this to do it in uprightneſs without deceit. There is much deceit attends the Truth, that if Souls that walk in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Truth, be not careful to watch, they may (as many do) imbrace that for Truth, that is but an imitation and likeneſs, and not the Truth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>That ſouls may have a little help in this work, could not but lend my ſmall mite of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb facs="tcp:38218:11"/>and write down in this day of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, what Experience I have had of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits that attend God's dear Appointments, through mens miſtakes; and alſo the Deceits that attend Prayer, and Sorrow for Sin, or at leaſt ſo pretended; and the Deceit in Love; and that grand Deceit that attends Souls in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, calling the heat and warmneſs, and elivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they gain from thence, Experiences and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments from Preſence.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many more, hath my ſoul met with in my day; which for the help of others I have (as I ſaid before) aſſerted in this day of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: Though, my beloved Friends, if any ſuch reade this, I muſt tell you, that I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, although this time of my Impriſonment be a ſeaſon fit for this ſervice upon my account, yet by reaſon of that Cloud that's caſt upon me out of pretended ends to bring honour to God; And how much dirt, is not onely by them caſt in my face, but in the face of all that ſhew ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and love to me; ſo that it's a bad ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for ſure I cannot expect but that even what I have here writ, ſhall meet with many repulſes, and little acceptance; therefore I wiſh it might have come from ſome other hands than mine, being willing to ſuffer any thing, ſo the Truth may be at liberty, and not ſuffer for my ſake. But yet ſure, ſome ſons of Truth will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Truth for the Truths ſake, to them I principally recommend this.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:38218:11"/>
            <p>And I have ſet down ſome of thoſe dear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Upholds, I have enjoyed from God ſince I came into this Priſon; that others may through the knowledge of Priſon-mercies, learn, not to fear a Priſon. O my Friends, a Priſon is not to be feared, if we ſuffer not as evil-doers, and do but enjoy God there; for Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence makes a Priſon a Palace. None knows the worth, power and riches of Preſence, till it be enjoyed; and when enjoyed, the leſs of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts attend it, and the more of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and croſſes accompany it, the more glorious and ſweet it is.</p>
            <p>Now, my dear Friends, I beg of you, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what by me is here writ, To let your eyes be off from the dirt, which is (though unjuſtly) caſt upon me, when you reade any of Gods Love and Beauty; and let not the Clouds that lie on me, hinder you from ſearching and imbracing what is here aſſerted, in faithfulneſs and love for your ſervice, That you may by others miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, learn to ſtand faſt, and to keep cloſe to God, to Chriſt, and to his Truth; following of the Lamb in this latter day, with that <hi>Love, Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> that the Day, and Work of the Day calls for. That you may be ſo, I commend you, and my own ſoul, to God, and the Word of his Grace, and remain,</p>

               <signed>Yours in that Love of which Chriſt is the Life. <hi>P. H.</hi>

            <p>The next Scripture God did bring refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38218:18"/>to my heart by, ſince I came into my cloſe confinement, is <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.25. from whence I was made to ſee, that it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent way for any Chriſtian, to go to ſave himſelf when Chriſt calls to ſuffer for him.</p>
            <p>And it alſo ſhews the ſafety and profit of having a generous ſpirit for Chriſt. If a ſoul doth freely ſo render it ſelf up to Chriſts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, not minding its own ſafety, but Chriſts Service, that ſoul ſhall not loſe, but gain: Each word Chriſt here ſpeaks, is upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; <hi>If he will ſave, he ſhall loſe; if he will loſe, he ſhall find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſave life, and in a ſpecial manner, a mans own life, is in it ſelf a duty the Law requires, yet here it ſeems to croſs it: no no, Chriſt only ſhews a new way to ſave life, and that not upon uncertainty, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and direction how to do it; 'tis but leave, and live; that is, leave all to Chriſt's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in his calling or diſpoſing of us in his Service and Suffering; if we ſo love Him, his Intereſt and Cauſe, we ſhall not, we cannot loſe, but gain.</p>
            <p>Now that there is no loſs by loſing all on this ſide Chriſt for Chriſt, you will ſee, if we conſider theſe things;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> All that we loſe in this ſence, in it ſelf is nothing; <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.5. it is ſaid there, <hi>It is not;</hi> that is, 'tis nothing; and in <hi>Amos</hi> 6.13. 'tis ſaid to be <hi>a thing of nought;</hi> that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38218:19"/>is, it's nothing; and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. 'tis ſaid to be a <hi>faſhion;</hi> now faſhions they change, and that which is to day, is not to morrow, but paſſeth away; ſo that if this be loſt, when as in it ſelf it's nothing, what can be loſt out of nothing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider that whatſoever is loſt, or laid down for Chriſt, cannot be a loſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's only lent, and God and Chriſt have given ſufficient ingagement, to repay with an hundred fold improvement. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29.</p>
            <p>But this Text aſſures us, of not only free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from loſs, but a finding or gain.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould ſay, <hi>Wherein is a Saints gain in thus ſuffering?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer, Firſt, mind this; no ſooner is the ſoul upon the wheel of ſuffering for Chriſt, but God and Chriſt is upon their motion to riſe and ſerve them: And that,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By inquiring into their ſtate and condition; as he did in the old time.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By giving forth a ſuitable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace to carry them through it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By debating with the tryal, and waiting it out, that it may be in meaſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When its gone forth and ſeized upon a Saint, God ſtands by it, and if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears too heavy, he makes it lighter, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the heart a lift into the higher Life and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38218:19"/>ſtrength, or by taking ſome of that away; See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.3, 7.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> While that is on, that he in his Wiſdom ſeeth beſt to be on, Chriſt ſtands in ſo great a ſympathy with them, that he is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in their affliction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9. and it is ſuch a ſympathy, that cauſes Chriſt not to ſtand ſilent, but to ſympathize with the ſoul, ſo as to ſend it and carry it anſwerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Grace that God gives ſouls in ſuch a ſuffering day, is not only ſo much as may and doth anſwer their troubles, but it doth over-ballance and tranſcend all their ſorrows; See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 5.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> God doth not only keep Saints in ſuffering, and bring them out without loſs, but he makes even their affliction, to increaſe profit and gain to the Soul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> God is ſo indulgently tender of Saints, and their good and gain in a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, that rather than they ſhall want what is in his hand or heart, he will with his own Preſence be with them, and abide with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1, 2. if they go, he goes, if they be put into the water and fire, ſo will he too: See the three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.24, 25. and if ſhut up in priſon where they are kept dark, there God will ſhew them more than before, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.3, 8. whatſoever they want or are, in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38218:20"/>point of comfort deprived of, God preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes it up, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.7, 8.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> And to make up all, after his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten coming down to them, and inriching them, by his giving forth, Light, Love, Life, and all, that they may be fully gainers, he will take them up to himſelf, and ſo to live in eternal Glory with them for ever, where ſin, and ſinners, ſuffering and ſickneſs ſhall trouble them no more, but all ſorrow and ſighing ſhall paſs away, and all tears ſhall be wiped from their eyes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.17. chap. 21.4. <hi>O come Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
            <p>O now my Soul, what loſs is there by loſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Chriſt, his Cauſe and Intereſt? Ah, happy is the ſoul that is imployed in this work! O who would not leave it ſelf, and its all, to Him and his diſpoſal, and never choſe, or refuſe its own Cup that the Father mixes and gives to us? O my ſoul, truſt God, he is Faithful, and will make good every tittle of his Promiſes. See 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.56. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.16.</p>
            <p>Now the next Scripture God brought comfort to my Soul by, was <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Fear none of theſe things which you ſhall ſuffer: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon, that you may be tryed, and ye ſhall have tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ten dayes; but be faithful, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe <hi>ten dayes</hi> is an uncertain time; and that the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38218:20"/>word <hi>Ten</hi> is taken for an uncertain time, is clear, if you mind <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.7, 41. &amp; <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.22. &amp; <hi>Job</hi> 19.2.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="Object."/>
            <p>Object. <hi>The Ten Horns in</hi> Dan. 7.7. <hi>ſure is a certain number.</hi>
            </p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="Answ."/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, 'tis ſo; but mind, the word Ten is not barely expreſſed, and ſo left, but it is expounded <hi>verſe</hi> 24. <hi>Theſe Ten Horns are ten Kings;</hi> ſo that it is not there left as in the other places, but when 'tis expreſſed, and not fixed to a certain number, it is to be minded as an uncertain time; ſo that by <hi>ten dayes,</hi> muſt be meant an uncertain time. Some ſay 'its to be meant, a day for a year, and the longeſt time of perſecution that ever was ſince Chriſt's time, was but Ten years; but I judge it beſt to mind this as in other places, <hi>many dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But from it I am made to ſee, that to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute Saints is the Devils work; God makes uſe of the Devil to do his drudgery. Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is God's way to ſcoure and rub the ruſt off from his Servants: it's work fit for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; but the profit of it is fit for none but Saints. O I have cauſe herein to bleſs God, for I have cauſe to ſay, there was much ruſt got in my lazie time upon my heart, and over my Experiences and Graces, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God and his wayes; O if this be God's rubbing and clearing day, I muſt ſay as <hi>Peter, Not only my hands, but all over.</hi> O my
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38218:21"/>God, did my Eſtate gather or cauſe ruſt? thou tooks away that, and thou didſt ſee my Name dead. Didſt thou ſee my Name, being too large for my Nature, cauſed ruſt? thou haſt ſuffered that to be blaſted; and thou ſeeſt that both my Liberty and Life, gather ruſt? wilt thou alſo take that? Do Lord, do Lord what thou wilt, ſo thou wilt bring me out as Gold, like <hi>Job, Job</hi> 23.10. and that is the next words in the Text; and ſee what follows in this, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Be faithful to the death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life:</hi> Saints faithfulneſs is to be ſuch, as not only to hold out in ſome dangers, but to death; O there is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reward, a Crown, and that a Crown of Life; all earthly Crowns are dead, or dying Crowns, this a living Crown, or a Crown of Life: O who would but ſtrive, wait and work for ſuch a Crown! well might Chriſt exhort Saints not to fear any thing that ſhall befal them of this nature.</p>
            <p>Now the chiefeſt word that God made of weight to my Soul from theſe words, was theſe firſt words, <hi>Fear none of theſe things;</hi> O there is not only one ſort of Sufferings, but all ſorts muſt attend Saints; but none is to be feared.</p>
            <p>Now upon my minding this, theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations did follow me.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is no cauſe of fear where the object of fear is removed. Now the matter
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38218:21"/>of Fear or Fearfulneſs is Evil. The Evil of all afflictions on Saints, is removed by God through Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.8. That made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Though in the valley of the ſhadow of death, not to fear Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is no cauſe of Fear of that or them which come either to ſerve us or ſave us; Now al Suffering on Saints as Saints, comes to ſerve them, and ſo to ſave them, ſometimes from ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. and ſometimes from the evil to come, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is no cauſe of fear of that which accompliſheth no Evil, but alwayes Good; if all doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. then Sufferings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is ground of fear of them, or that which is conquered before we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with it, as all ſufferings and cenſures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 35, 39.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There is no fear to walk in that way, which Chriſt our Captain hath gone before us in and tryed it, and not only ſo, but he holds us by the hand, nay, heart, all the way.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There is no fear of that, though never ſo great a croſs, if it be the eminent way to the Crown, as Sufferings are; See <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> There is no fear to meet with God in the way, and day of his favours: for Saints ſuffering ſeaſon is God's obſerving
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38218:22"/>ſeaſon to give forth his Loves, 'tis his very high market dayes; See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.2, 3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.3.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> What cauſe of fear is there of that, which doth not, nor can deſtroy the Foundation of Faith? O it is ſo far from that, that it is rather an opportunity for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to give forth it ſelf like a Fountain ful of all freſh Springs. See I pray, ſee <hi>David</hi> ſee the three Children, ſee <hi>Daniel,</hi> what ſtreams of Light, Love, nay Life, was given forth at ſuch ſuffering ſeaſons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. and 27.1, 2, 3. and 138.3, 7.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> What cauſe is there of fear of that which is appointed to teſtifie and ſeal to our Faith, and our Intereſt in God's Love and eternal Life?</p>
            <p n="10">
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> What cauſe is there to fear that which is but the opening the door to let us into converſe with God? as all Sufferings of Saints is no more, but God's turning the key to unlock the door, and let Souls into a living converſe with God; for where the world ſhuts Saints out, God takes them in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38218:22"/>way not only to follow Chriſt, but it's that by which the ſoul is made conformable to Chriſt, and to his Death, and the Power of his Reſurrection, 'tis what <hi>Paul</hi> groaned for, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> What cauſe is there to fear to meet with that, which is to accompliſh the end of our Faith, to wit, the Salvation of our ſouls, and eternal Glory with God &amp; Chriſt, and all the Aſſembly of Saints, the <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> and Angels for evermore. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>O theſe conſiderations did follow me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes and nights, till my Soul cryed out, <hi>Lord, where am I, Lord what am I, that I ſhould be thus honoured?</hi> O bleſſed be God for ever. After, this or upon this conſent from theſe conſiderations there was a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did ariſe in me, which was to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Why men may ſuffer much and long and yet be nothing. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. <hi>of a man give his body to be burnt, it will not do without Charity:</hi> So then the queſtion was, who are true Sufferers, or when doth a ſoul ſuffer rightly, and when not?</p>

            <p>Now thus to ſuffer willingly, not for any thing we have done to the World, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are called out of the world, thus to ſuffer is to ſuffer as a Saint: therefore Chriſt makes proviſion for this, when he tells his Diſciples, that the World hated him, and ſo would hate them, in that they were not of the world; for the World can only love its own.</p>

               </gap> Gods Appointments, or Goſpel-Ordinances and why of late I did not walk with them
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38218:24"/>I uſed to do, and deſiring my Judgement; which I did give them; and cannot omit, but inſert it here, and ſhall faithfully ſpeak to both, and to the laſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, 'Tis true, I did for many yeares walk with theſe Friends in <hi>P.F.</hi> and the ten laſt years with them at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and my care and pains there to attend both them at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Durham</hi> I ſhall not declare, but leave it to them that were eye witneſſes; and the rather, becauſe ſome here in <hi>London</hi> are pleaſed to reproach me, and affirm the contrary: Now ſince that I came to <hi>London,</hi> at or about which time, I for the moſt part did uſe to imploy my Gifts among the People that walk with Mr. <hi>K.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to my not continuing with them as before, there be many cauſes, that if any unbyaſſed hearts will judge, they will not condemn me as they do. It was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, but under trouble of mind, I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to live at peace; I went beyond Sea to <hi>Holland,</hi> and had no evil intent, as God knows and bears me record; but as ſoon as I was gone, thoſe, or ſome of thoſe I moſt prized, raiſed a report, <hi>That I was gone to carry on Deſigns againſt the People of God;</hi> at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which I was exceedingly grieved; and though I writ over, and imployed friends to inquire the cauſe; yet to this day I could not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38218:25"/>find out the reaſon; only a ſad malitious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit raiſed it.</p>
            <p>So I came over with a deſire, though I dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to vindicate my ſelf, but as I and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends indeavoured it, this ſpirit privately went up and down to carry it on, and promiſed in ſo many weeks it would be made good; thoſe weeks we ſtayed; then in three months it would be made good; we ſtayed three times three months, but ſtill it was as it was; and though he that was by them imployed to devulge it, ſaw his and their evil, as ſome faithful Friends can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet theſe parties did ſtill perſiſt in their way; and the Report was all over the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the wounding of my ſoul, and many more: I did by ſome ſend privately to ſee if I might come to their Private Meetings; this was the return, <hi>they ſhould be afraid of me if I did come;</hi> and all this time, of all theſe thouſands that did report this, not ſix ever came either to reprove me, or to exhort me to my duty: And when them of <hi>P. F.</hi> left their place for fear, I ſent a Letter to them to keep together, and deſired that if they would not, that they would let me appear there; it was not accepted: and when they all left it, I did once go and appear, and for ſo doing, how I was cenſured, many can witneſs. I knew not what to do, but began to think, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould I go; I ſaw a People that was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38218:25"/>come out from them, and joyned with <hi>N. S.</hi> that had kept themſelves more clear than the reſt; but ſearching the Scriptures, I could not find clearneſs for their coming off as Members from a Church or Churches, till a Church had unchurched themſelves, and I could not ſee that they had, by what they had then done; and for Members to reaſſume the power of withdrawing, which is only in a Church, and not in particular Members to act ſo towards a Church, was ſo ſtrange, that there I could not joyn if I might, ſo that my way was ſtopt up from all ſuch way of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</p>
            <p>Then I only preſſed ſome friends that lay under trouble for others miſcaryings to keep together, and for us to pray, and to exhort and to edifie each other; and this I did, not daring to miſs an opportunity, as they can witneſs, for all the fears that did attend us. Now if any ſoul without prejudice, would but take up the matter, in the true fear and love of God, they cannot juſty condemn me: though they which were moſt near, or ought to be ſo, do condemn me, I bleſs God I have peace.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:38218:31"/>
            <head>Some Obſervations uſeful for all that fear God; but in particular, left for my Children.</head>
            <p>VVHen ever a heart hath a ſenſible injoyment of God, and his Love in Chriſt, eſpecially as a return of Prayers, mind theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Expect a freſh aſſault of Satan, with high attempts to draw the ſoul aſide, either to looſeneſs under that love, or ſome other evil improvements. When Chriſt was in the Wilderneſs, and was inriched with high In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richments of God, he was preſently ſet on by Satan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1, 3, 5, 8. And as ſoon as <hi>Hezekiah, Iſa.</hi> 38.5. was delivered and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with God's Love, was preſently ſet on to be tempted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39.1.</p>
            <p>So let all that fear the Lord, at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but in an eſpecial manner, then double their worth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sin and Satan never gets into us, and is imbraced, but as Sin comes, God goes, and ſo Sin gets ſtrength, and the Soul gathers weakneſs. If ſo,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Soul that doth not ſo much as reſiſt Sin in its firſt attempts, he may be confident he will be overcome: O then take
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38218:31"/>this from a ſoul that hath had experience; Keep the watch moſt over thy heart, thy eyes and words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is eaſie to ſin God out of ſight, but not ſo eaſie to pray him in: If ſo, O ſtand faſt in God's Fear; and when moſt injoyed, let him be moſt prized, and Sin moſt feared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Sin leaſt ſeen, is the moſt futile and hardeſt conquered: Then watch and mourn moſt for that which is leaſt ſeen. Heart-Sin, as to men, ſeemeth leaſt, but as to God, hated moſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> No ſoul ſeeketh for Pardon ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, unleſs he is as much and as eagerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of Power againſt Sin, as Pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Sins of Conſtitution are moſt to be feared, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. But when Sins of Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion get into cuſtome, then Sin hath got both its wings, &amp; only a mighty Power of God can conquer it. O fear the Sin of Conſtitution, as Death; and Cuſtome, as Hell: for if they once joyn, they will cauſe the ſoul to fly out of ſight of Preſence, and ſight of Experience, and all ability to return. If ſo, mind;</p>
            <p>When a ſoul is there, to go back it cannot, to go forward is death and Hell, ſo then all it can do under its loſs, is to ſhrink down into its empty nothing ſtate, and lye low in it ſelf with its eye ſingly on Free-Grace in Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:38218:32"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> No heart thus truly lying low, but is lifted up; when up; ſtand in fear, ſin no more.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Obſervations as to Duty.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Lye low, and pray till God come in; but pray most when he is come in; for the ſoul prays best when he injoys God most:</hi> Call while he is near, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A Soul doth not gain, but loſe, by keeping from Duty, for the want of the Life of Duty.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pride in Prayer, eates out the heart of Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Experience is a good concomitent of Prayer, but no way ſafe to be a Foundation of Faith or Prayer; God's promiſed Word is only a fit Foundation for that work.</p>
               <p>In a word, Nothing can or is a fit Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but this which doth ſtand when all falls.</p>
               <p>Prayer is a Duty God calls for, and it is a way to acknowledge God; but it was never intended to change or alter God, but to change us, and not force God, but fit us for
<pb facs="tcp:38218:32"/>what's promiſed and purpoſed of God for us.</p>
               <p>That heart prays beſt, that appears leaſt in its own name or nature.</p>
               <p>And that heart prevailes moſt, that prays moſt in the Name, that is to ſay, in the true Nature of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Then we may deſcribe Prayer thus;</p>
               <p>Prayer is the exerciſe of God's Spirit in us, pouring out the Soul to God, in the Name, that is to ſay, in the Nature of Chriſt, and in his Intereſt, pleading with God for ſupply of wants, in anſwer to his Will.</p>
               <p>Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So Prayer is the Language of God in us, not to alter God, but us; not to beget new Grace in God, but from his old Grace, to bring down renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſupplies to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The way to keep a heart from ſinful liſtings up in Prayer, is truly to know the Life of Prayer is not its own, but comes down from God before it is in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nothing prevails with God but what's his own;</hi> therefore prevailing Prayer is not ours, but God's: <hi>The true ſence of this layes down, what the Devil by duty would lift up; that heart ſeldome prevailes by Prayer under tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſtraits and difficulties, that keeps its eye
<pb facs="tcp:38218:33"/>upon the Difficulties, and not on a Promiſe. That Faith or Prayer honours God beſt, that truſteth and eyes God most in the face of a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſibility.

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>Let me now ſpeak a word of Advice to my Relations and Friends, as to the Deceit that attends men and women in their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Love.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be careful in loving Sanits, that you love them as Saints; if ſo, you will love them beſt in whom you ſee moſt of Chriſt and Grace, though ſtrangers other wayes to you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They that are moſt faithful, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in reproving you for ſin, or neglect of duty to Chriſt, are the fiteſt objects of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Love; and when there is leaſt Deceit in thy love, theſe will be, not leaſt, but moſt beloved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Love is commonly the beſt, that loves that moſt that is ſeen leaſt; and that is not ſo much for acts without, as Grace within.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it be a true Love, it is a laſting Love, and holds out in times of danger, as well as in times of proſperous duty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. True Love is ſeen moſt and known beſt, when as the party beloved is in a low ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:38218:33"/>condition; for the Life of true Love lies much in ſympathizing with that it loves; So then that Love that only loves while and when the object beloved can communicate or anſwer its Love with a reciprocal good or profit, but when the object lies under ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or cenſures, or wants, it draws back and dyes, it's a falſe Love; for true Love doth principally manifeſt it ſelf in Unity, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and Sympathy, and in the laſt is ſeen moſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Where true Love is, there is a Spirit that attends it, that is the Life of it; and where this Love doth God-like, and Chriſt-like, go forth to love, the Spirit of that Love goes forth into the object beloved, indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uniting the heart and life of each other; As <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. True God-like and Chriſt-like Love, is not only a ſympathizing and uniting Love, but it's a bearing &amp; covering Love, it's nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eyed to ſee Beauty, but very dim to ſee Deformity.</p>
               <p>But becauſe there is ſo much deceit in Love, let me adviſe you to take heed of falſe Love, or imitating Love, that will deceive.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Love will deceive, that loves Parts more than Principles, yet think it is for Principles they love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When as their Love to the party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, is very high and violent while the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:38218:34"/>is in credit, but if under reproach, or clouds, or cenſures, their ſeeming Love, is with great eaſe &amp; readineſs, turned into cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, and for the moſt part, without either examination or reluctancy: but in true Love where Life goes out, it is not ſo eaſily called in, but will turn and ſearch, and ſearch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will ſhift.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third deceit rides only upon, or moſt upon the wing of <hi>Oneneſs</hi> in Judgment, as to the viſible wayes of God &amp; Chriſt, or in other wayes; but others that have more Grace, are not ſo much beloved, unleſs they be of the ſame length, breadth &amp; heighth in point of Judgment: this ſort of Love is the moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally deceivable in this day; and yet the moſt ſad threed-bare Love that ever the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſpun.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is, when Souls love only ſo long as they are beloved.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another Deceit in Love is, When men in their Love, under the notion of Religion or Grace, are more to women than to men; and in women to men more than to women; all Love ought to be lookt after, but this to have a double watch.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the beſt way to try the Truth of Love, is by the Properties that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures witneſs to be in true Love, I ſhall ſay no more as to the Truth or Deceit that is in Love, by the rule of my own experience; but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38218:34"/>beſeech my Relations and Friends to mind well what the Apoſtle ſaith of true Love in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. to the 8th verſe; where the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natural and eſſential Properties of Love is aſſerted; and ſo aſſerted, that they that can witneſs what's there ſaid, may aſſuredly know their Love is true; and if the contrary be found in you, or any, you may with the ſame aſſurance know, your Love, though it appear never ſo high, yet it is but falſe deceitful imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Love.</p>
               <p>It is good to conſider well what Love is; true Spiritual Love ſprings out of God; and what it truly is; it returns to God, carrying the heart where it is truly placed, along with it to God, and there it's fixed and centered.</p>
               <p>And though it may ſhake hands in its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with an inferiour good; yet 'tis not at home, but as it is, and when it is with God; for in that Union is its <hi>being,</hi> and in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with that good is its <hi>well being.</hi> If you take Love in its Parts, you will ſee more of is Excellency.</p>

               <p>And ſo Zeal is moſt properly attributed to God. This was a good Friends deſcription of Love. And now mind,</p>
               <p>True Love never dies to what it truly loves; for it never ſo loves but where it lives: it lives in union and communion with the Good it loves. Now that you may the better ſee the Nature and undeceivable Properties of true Love, or Charity, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. to the 8th verſ, ſee the 4th verſ. <hi>Charity,</hi> or Love, <hi>ſuffers long;</hi> that is, it is not eaſily provoked; or a better reading is, <hi>It's ſlow to anger;</hi> ſo that a heart truly inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Grace of Love, is a mild and meek heart, not full of fire and fury, but if occaſions be offered, it is drawn, as the God of Love is, to afflict, but not willingly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not only ſlow to anger, <hi>but kind;</hi> the word may be read <hi>Bountiful;</hi> that is, the heart thus loving, is not only bound up from fury of one hand, but it's on the other hand at that ſeaſon full of Kindneſs or Bounty; that is to ſay, it's not only backward to anſwer evil with anger, but to conquer it with Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and readineſs to do good againſt evil.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It envies not;</hi> that is to ſay, it doth not only ceaſe from acts of fury, ſhewing it ſelf paſſionate, but at that time it doth not ſo much inwardly envy or wiſh hurt to any, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38218:35"/>ſence it's quietly contented with its own por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and God's diſpoſe to enemies and friends.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Love vaunteth not it ſelf;</hi> that is, as you may ſee in the Margent of your Books, it's not inconſiderate, but weigheth all things, and is ſerious and conſiderate, in doing, and loving, and ſaying, it doth not do things raſhly.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>It's not puffed up;</hi> that is, it is not the property of a heart inriched with true Love, to ſwell, &amp; to be frothyly fil'd with the wind of it's own conceits, as bear gifts or imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-grace upon every occaſion of its own advance, will be.</p>

The Death of the Croſs; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs;</hi> and Gal. 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a Curſe for us; as it is written, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree;</hi> the moſt contemptible Death that could be, a curſed Death, a ſhameful diſhonourable Death. O ſee what bleſſed Love was here ſhewed, in this curſed and ſhameful <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Not only to death, and the death of the Croſs, but to all the Aggravations that could poſſibly accompany either. As thus;</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſuffered as a Sinner in the higheſt ſence: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. <hi>For I delivered unto you, firſt of all, that which I alſo received, How that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38218:49"/>Chriſt dyed for our Sins, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> and in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Sins make ſuffering unſufferable, elſe it is but a chaſtiſment if ſin be not in it; but if it be, then it is a puniſhment: yet even ſo muſt our dear Chriſt ſuffer as a fruit of the Fathers Love.</p>
               <p>2d Aggravation, was the exerciſe of God's Rage, Fury and Wrath in the Law againſt Sin; this, O this in the higheſt of it, was Chriſt given up to in his <hi>Death; Iſa.</hi> 63.3. <hi>I have trodden the Wine-Preſs alone, and there was none to help; for I will tread them in mine Anger, and trample them in my Fury, and their Blood ſhall be ſprinkled upon my Garments, and I will ſtain all my rayment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It was to, and by, the worſt of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: For <hi>Firſt,</hi> They were his Enemies. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their envy was in them, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors under the Notion of Religion; Wrath covered with Zeal is implacable, and ſuch are the worſt of Enemies; that Envy is the worſt, and where that is, there is no pitty: no more had they of our dear Saviour; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.6. <hi>I gave my back to the Smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting:</hi> Apply <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the higheſt of his Sufferings, when
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:38218:49"/>he was on the Croſs, in the ſence of his Sufferings, God did appear to forſake him; <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46. <hi>And about the ninth hour, Jeſus cryed with a loud voice,</hi> Eli, Eli, lamaſabach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thani; <hi>that is to ſay, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> O to loſe ſight and ſence of Preſence, is ſad: Suffering in it ſelf is ſufficient to ſink down a ſoul; but to loſe Preſence in the midſt and heighth of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, doth ſadly aggravate it: yet this muſt dear Chriſt be given up to. O what Love is there in God! O unſpeakable Love to poor Sinners! that to accompliſh their good and ſafety, his Son muſt thus ſuffer, and be thus forſaken.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing in order is, How God gave him up.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Freely;</hi> for he was not ſought to by any for Chriſt thus to be given up, nor no purchaſe ſhould have been given, if he had been ſo offered; but God doth it freely: In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.2. <hi>Wherefore when I came, there was no man; when I called, there was none to anſwer. Is my hand ſhortned at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver?</hi> &amp;c. And chap. 63.5. <hi>And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own Arm brought Salvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and my Fury it upheld me.</hi> Beſides, all his Tearms in his Tenders of this dear Chriſt, are free.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:38218:50"/>
               <p n="2">2. As he did it freely as to us, ſo he did it with the <hi>greateſt ſeverity</hi> as to him; and that you will ſee, if you conſider theſe Scriptures; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. applyed with <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. from the 29, to the 50, verſe, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him up for us all; how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> And in that 8th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> conſider what it is; for God not to ſpare his Son, as the Word is, <hi>He Spared not his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1ſt. <hi>Not to Spare,</hi> implies or ſignifies the higheſt Severity of Juſtice; <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Thou ſhalt not conſent unto him, nor hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, neither ſhall thine eye pitty him, neither ſhalt thou Spare, neither ſhalt thou conceal him;</hi> Iſa. 13.18. <hi>Their Bowes alſo ſhall daſh the young men to pieces, and they ſhall have no pitty on the Fruit of the Womb, their eyes ſhall not ſpare Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2dly. It's to let out Juſtice upon one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt exerciſe of pitty, or any reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or roulings of bowels of compaſſion. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.14. <hi>And I will daſh them one againſt another, even the Father and the Sons together, I will not pitty, nor Spare, nor have mercy, but deſtroy them;</hi> Ezek. 7.4, 8, 9. In the 4th verſe, <hi>And mine eye ſhall not Spare thee, neither will I have pitty, but I will recompence thy wayes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and thine abomination ſhall be in the midſt of thee, and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>3dly, It implies a laying aſide all regard or reſpect to the party ſuffering. See this word ſo expreſt, <hi>Job</hi> 30.10. <hi>They abhor me, they flee far from me, they Spare not to ſpit in my face.</hi> And as it was there with <hi>Job,</hi> ſo it was with Chriſt. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.6. <hi>I gave my back to the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>From all this, if you conſider it, you will ſee, it was from God upon Chriſt, with the greateſt Severity that could be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God did not only give him unto us freely (as to Chriſt) with the greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, but he did it <hi>delightfully: Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath

               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> thing is, For whom he gave him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He gave him for Sinners; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>But God commendeth his Love towards us, in that while we were yet Sinners, Chriſt dyed for us:</hi> And in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful Saying, and worthy of all acceptation, That Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave Sinners; of whom I am the chief.</hi>

O this heightens God's Love: O rich Love! God loves them that hate him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> thing is, God's End in giving his Son.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. His End was to overcome and conquer, that or them, that would have deſtroyed us: As firſt, <hi>Sin; Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> and in verſe 25. <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. So then, with the mind I ſerve the Law of God, but with the fleſh the Law of ſin.</hi> Secondly, The <hi>Law; Gal.</hi> 2.19. <hi>For through the Law, I am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God:</hi> Rom. 8.2. <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Death;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56. <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy victory? The ſting of Death is Sin, and the ſtrength of Sin is the Law.</hi> Fourthly, The <hi>World; John</hi> 16.33. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace; in the World ye ſhall have tribulation: but be of good chear, I have overcome the World.</hi> Fifthly, The <hi>Devil.</hi> In 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil.</hi> O what an End is that! O reckon every End, and they all end in one End for us poor Sinners.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His End was, To bring up poor Souls as into Union, ſo into Communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and Son, in all their Light, Life, Love
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:38218:53"/>and Glory; John 17.21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they alſo may be one in us; that the World may believe that thou haſt ſent Me:</hi> ver. 22. <hi>And the Glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one as We are one:</hi> verſe 23. <hi>I in Them, and Thou in Me, that They may be made perfect in One, and that the World may know that Thou haſt ſent Me, and haſt loved Them as thou haſt loved Me.</hi> Apply 1 John 1.3. and 1 Pet. 1.3, 4, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His End was, That we might have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder our Faith and Confidence in Him, in our appeals and approaches to him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need.</hi> And in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs, and acceſs with confidence by the Faith of him.</hi> O mind theſe Scriptures, poor Soul; if thou wanteſt Faith, go, O go, in the Faith of Jeſus.

               <p n="2">2d. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> That it might appear, as to be an act of God's Wiſdom, ſo ſingularly an act of Love; which other wayes could not have been, had not all other things in the world have been loſt and overlooked.</p>

               <p>Now for the Improvements of this rich Soul-ſupporting Truth, mind in theſe Uſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>Uſe,</hi> To inform us of the great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Love and Grace of God to poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which is ſo fully made out in this Act of God, in giving his Son in this manner.

                     <item>1. We may from this be certain, of God's Satisfaction by Chriſt for all Sin; for ſure God would never have done this, had or could there have been a Diſ-ſatisfaction to have over-ballanced his Satisfaction. Mind theſe Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11, &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27. O ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10, 12, 14, 17, verſes; and you will ſee this made clear.</item>

                     <item>3. To aſſure us, That there is no Enemy
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:38218:54"/>left unconquered; for had any thing been too ſtrong for God, this work could not have been accompliſhed; but nothing could, nor was too ſtrong for God, neither Sin, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. nor Law, nor Death, nor World, nor Devil; and if ſo, look upon, and encounter with all theſe as conquered before, you encounter.</item>
                     <item>4. It's to aſſure us, That the Foundation of Salvation is more ſure, than to ſtand upon ſuch a weak changeable foundation as our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or goodneſs is; It's done only and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by God, and the Foundation is as ſure as he is; 'tis alone his rich Love and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Grace in Chriſt. See the Text, &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>5. 'Tis to aſſure us, and that with all clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, That God's Love to the worſt of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is as great as to Jeſus Chriſt: Seeing all this God gave up Chriſt to, was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh not his, but their good, ſee John 17.23, 24, 26.1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 13.14. O what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is here to a poor ſoul! conſider what dear, what rich, what delightful Love was there, and is there in God for Chriſt; and what will this Love carry God to do for Chriſt? do but mind it, and then conſider, that that Love, the ſame Love, with all its Riches, with all its Strength, with all its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, is in the heart of God for me. O ſoul, lye down and admire this Love!</item>
                     <item>6. To aſſure us, That as God's Love was not cauſed by us, nor moved, or brought forth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:38218:55"/>from any cauſe in us, ſo it cannot be changed or deſtroyed by us; certainly if Sins foreſeen, would not, nor could not keep God from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt, ſure when they are brought forth, they cannot turn God and Chriſt from loving of us.</item>
                     <item>7. To aſſure us, in way of Comfort, That the whole, and full, and ſole work of ſuffering for Sin, and ſatisfying of Juſtice for Sin, is done by Chriſt; ſo that, what ſorrows and ſufferings do attend Saints, there is no ſuch end produced by it, as to ſatisfie unſatisfied Juſtice; but all that befals Saints, are Fruits of Love, to put away Sin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.9. and to give down more Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>8. It is furthermore to aſſure us, and that of Certainty, from all that hath been ſaid, That there is a willingneſs in God, not only to ſave, but to receive poor Sinners into his Grace and Favour, or elſe he would never have given ſo much to accompliſh it: all his Coſt and Labour declares this; which you will fully ſee, if you go over all that hath bee ſaid.

               <p>And firſt of the firſt; and in it mind.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew you the certainty of the Souls ſeparation from the body, and that it dyes not with the body, as ſome ſay, but when it's ſeparated, it doth enjoy Priviledges with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as is implyed in this word. After I have done that, I ſhall let you know in what ſence the Soul is taken; and alſo give you the Scriptures and Reaſons that ſome have to prove the Soul to be <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi> with a brief Anſwer to that: And then we ſhall give you ſufficient Scriptures and Reaſons, that there is a Soul or Spirit in man that lives, though the body dyes; and alſo give you a hint of ſome of the Priviledges that the Soul enjoys after its ſeparation from the body, and then make ſome improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Now in the firſt place, I ſhall let you have ſome Scriptures to prove that there is a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration betwixt Soul and Body, according to the Doctrine, and ſhew ſome Reaſons for it; the Scriptures to prove it are theſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.18.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:38218:57"/>18. <hi>Job</hi> 34.14, 15. to them apply <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.26. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59, 60. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.21. and ſo much for Scriptures; the Reaſons follow.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The firſt <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Is from God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
                  <item>The ſecond <hi>Reaſon,</hi> From the the very nature of Soul and Body, the one Spirit, the other Fleſh and Duſt: As it is unnatural for a Spirit naturally to dye, ſo it is as unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for duſt and fleſh for ever to live, without being changed from a Natural to a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42, 43, 44.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If it be objected, <hi>That by this,</hi> Adam <hi>muſt have dyed if he had not ſinned.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="A"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is a Queſtion that the beſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer; for there is more ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that if he had not ſinned, yet his fleſhly body muſt have had a time to have changed, becauſe it was duſt, and ſo natural, and not of the nature of Eternity; and to that end do not only mind the Natural Reaſon, but this Scriptural Ground.</p>
               <p>Whatever was a fruit of Sin, Chriſt by his Death freed Saints from; but Chriſt frees no ſoul from a Natural Death; <hi>Ergo,</hi> A Natural Death is not a bare and only fruit of ſin: if it were, every Saint through believing in Chriſt would be freed from it: but none are,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:38218:57"/>
                  <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> But this is a diſpute amongſt the greateſt of the Learned, and I ſhall enter no further into it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall let you know in what ſence the Scripture repreſents the Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes it is taken for the <hi>whole man,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14, &amp;c. <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.2, 3. and <hi>chap.</hi> 7.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. It is taken only for <hi>fleſhly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral blood,</hi> and ſo the common life of man; <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.26.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. It's taken for the <hi>affection of the ſoul:</hi> as firſt for <hi>Love,</hi> as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1. Secondly, for <hi>Grief and Sorrow,</hi> Jer. 13.17.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. It is taken figuratively, for the <hi>Stomach,</hi> Prov. 27.7.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly. It is taken for the <hi>breath of a man, Jam.</hi> 2.26.</p>
               <p n="6">6thly. It is taken for the <hi>natural life</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the body, and alſo from the ſoul or ſpirit of a man.</p>
               <p n="7">7thly. It is taken for that Soul or Spirit which was breathed by God into <hi>Adam,</hi> by which he became a <hi>living Soul;</hi> this is <hi>that</hi> that never dies.</p>
               <p>And that there is ſuch a Spirit, or Soul, that never dies, I ſhall give you the Reaſons and Scriptures, to prove, That there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in a man, that is part of man, that lives
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:38218:58"/>and never dies; and that I ſhall prove from theſe Scriptures and Reaſons following, and then ſhall give a brief Anſwer, to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Reaſons, of ſuch as are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary mind.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> is grounded on <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.10. we reaſon thus, Had there been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to have lived and gone to God, it could not have been a departure, but a ceſſation; but it is ſaid, <hi>Her Soul departed, and ſhe dyed,</hi> that is to ſay, her body dyed: But had her ſoul dyed, there had been nothing to depart from the body.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Reaſon</hi> is from 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.21, 22. <hi>And he ſtretched himſelf upon the Child three times, and cryed unto the Lord, and ſaid, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this Child's ſoul come in to him again:</hi> v. 22. <hi>And the Lord heard the voice of</hi> Elijah, <hi>and the ſoul of the Child came in to him again, and he revived.</hi> Had the Child's ſoul been dead, the Prophet would not have prayed that it might return to the body, but that it might live again; But God heard him, and returned the ſoul of the Child, and then the body revived. Had the ſoul been dead, both muſt have revived; but the one returns, the other revives; ſo they were not both in one capacity.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Reaſon</hi> is from <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Who knoweth the ſpirit of a man that goeth upward, and the ſpirit the of beaſt that goeth downward to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:38218:58"/>the Earth?</hi> The <hi>Reaſon</hi> lies clear; did the ſoul of a man dye, when the body dies, it dyed as a beaſt; but here is a diſtinction, ſo that there is a difference. And where lies it? the Text tells you, <hi>That duſt goes to duſt, but the Spirit to God that gave it;</hi> ſo that it is clear that there is a part of a man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, and lives when the body dyes.</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Reaſon</hi> is from <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>And fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul; but rather fear him, which is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in Hell.</hi> A good ground to prove this, for Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul.</hi> Now, if the ſoul dyed with the body, then he that killed one, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity kill the other, but Chriſt ſaith plainly, they may <hi>kill the body,</hi> but <hi>not the ſoul:</hi> So there is a Soul, or part of man, that lives though the body dyes.</p>
               <p>The fifth <hi>Reaſon</hi> is from <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59. <hi>And they Stoned</hi> Stephen, <hi>calling upon God, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit:</hi> If there had been nothing in <hi>Stephen</hi> but what was to dye, his Prayer had been needleſs; but when his body was to dye, he prayes, that God would receive his ſpirit; ſo there was a ſpirit or ſoul to depart, and be received, though the body dyed.</p>
               <p>The ſixth <hi>Reaſon</hi> is from 2 Cor. 4.16. <hi>For which cauſe we faint not, but though our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:38218:59"/>man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day;</hi> From whence we reaſon thus, If all in man, that is one with man, dyed when the body dyes, then when the body had on it any part of death or decay, all in the body that is its own, muſt be ſo too; but here you ſee, there is ſomething that increaſes and gets up, when the body decreaſes and goes down.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh <hi>Reaſon</hi> is from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 8. <hi>Therefore, we are always confident, knowing that whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> and in <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>We are confident I ſay, and willing, rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> In which words you may ſee, that there is ſome part of man, which when the body dyes, is abſent from the body, and at that preſent is preſent with the Lord: now if all in man, that is of man, did dye with the body, then there was nothing to be preſent with God; but you may here ſee it is, and it was that which the Apoſtle groaned for.</p>
               <p>The Eighth <hi>Reaſon</hi> is from <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Furthermore, we have had fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits, and live?</hi> and Mat. 22.31, 32. <hi>But as touching the Reſurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto you by God, ſaying, I Am the God of</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:38218:59"/>Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob? <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> Now mind the words: There you ſee a great difference between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits, and the father of bodies or fleſh: Now if the Spirit or Soul in this ſenſe, were as the body, then the fathers of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or fleſh were alſo Fathers of the Soul or Spirit: beſides, you may ſee two diſtinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, father of the fleſhly part, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Spirit or Soul: the ſame is ſeen in this alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32.</p>
               <p>Now take a few Natural Reaſons.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Cauſe</hi> 7. You muſt mind, that Death is compared to a ſleep, and no man is willing to go to ſleep till he be fully weary; and for the moſt part Death comes to take us from the world before we are fully weary of the world. And ſometimes there is ſome work to do, and men are not willing without ſome reaſonings to go to ſleep before their work is done; Some Child to bring up, or ſome Wife to love a little longer, or Husband, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the Cauſes why Souls are at a ſtand or ſtrait when Death comes. I ſhould now ſhew you ſome of the Scriptures and Reaſons, that ſome bring to prove the Soul mortal, but they are not worth the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning; only mind their Scriptures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.2. <hi>Job</hi> 4.19, 21. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.1, 2. &amp; 7.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 34.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.46. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.15, 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 115.17. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18. theſe be the moſt of their Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Reaſons they draw, are from them; and they have ſome natural Reaſons, but in truth they are not worth the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: And as for their Scriptures, and their Reaſons from thence, do but reade the verſes
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:38218:63"/>before and after, and you will ſoon ſee the deceit; and in all your minding of any thing they ſay ſeems of force, do but well mind the Reaſons, and the Scriptures I have here laid down to prove the Soul immortal, and you will ſee the Truth; and alſo the falſhood of that ſad Opinion of holding <hi>the Mortallity of the Soul.</hi> Now we ſhould make ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this Truth, but being ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I ſhall leave that, Beſeeching God, to do you as much good in the knowledge of this Truth, as he hath done to my ſoul; and ſo the <hi>LORD JEHOVAH</hi> be your Strength.</p>
               <p>Now in anſwer to your deſires, becauſe I cannot get time to write at large, my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the difference betwixt the <hi>Old-Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> as the Scripture calls them, or the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace:</hi> Take a brief hint of a few Particulars of the different Property, and that thus;</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Condition of the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> was ſuch, that it did lay an <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of attaining the promiſed <hi>Good</hi> by it, and that you may ſee by viewing theſe Scriptures, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It kept ſouls in <hi>Fears,</hi> without any grounds of Certainty, or Aſſurance; for that which was done as it might be to day, was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:38218:64"/>to do again to morrow, as if it had not been before. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19, 27. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.9. and <hi>chap.</hi> 10.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was exceeding <hi>Coſtly,</hi> even ſo that the Coſt did exceed the Comforts; all their Service did ſo declare it: ſee 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.24.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Word or Declaration of it, was, in compariſon with the Declaration of the Goſpel, but a bare voice or ſound of words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 15, 24. The Promiſes belonging to it could not take place, till the Condition made way, and the Condition depended upon an impoſſibility, ſo that both together in it ſelf, did ſignify, but little more than a ſound of words, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Declaration of the Goſpel, or <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It begat great <hi>Fear in all that heard it;</hi> but the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Saving-Faith</hi> in none, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. Now bleſſed be God this is ended and taken out of the way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now the Comforts of this Change lies in the removing of the evil that did attend us in that. And 2dly. In the Fruition of the Good that is brought in by the <hi>New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> or the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> If you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after that Good, I muſt tell you, it is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:38218:64"/>not to be in its fulneſs, expreſſed by the tongue of Men and Angels: but take a few Particulars that have been of great uſe and comfort to my ſoul: and they are theſe,</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In that the Condition, as well as the Promiſes of Good, have their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate dependance as to performance, onely upon God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32, 33, 34. <hi>chap.</hi> 32.39, 40. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.17, 20. <hi>chap.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Good of Promiſes, are not cauſed, but cauſes of Performance; ſo that the good of Promiſes is the life of Duties: So that the life in Duties, doth not intail to the good of Promiſes, but we are to draw the life of Duties from our Intereſt in the good of Promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>

               </list>
               <p n="2">2dly. Its taken vertually, that is, all that Peace which Saints enjoy and receive by and through believing in Chriſt, called <hi>Peace of Conſcience,</hi> as in Rom. 5.1. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>It is a ſtate of Favour and Grace, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt according to an Agreement and Covenant made between God and Him, into which <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth inſtate all his, in which ſtate they have a perfect acceptance, and are compleat in the ſight of God; and there they have a friendly Amity, and ſweet Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and full Agreement, not only with God and Heaven, but alſo with the Earth and all things therein.

And as for the Proofs and Uſes, the dear Lord make them for you, and to you: And God forgive them, who out of envy to me have not ſpared to throw dirt in the face of the Truth aſwel as me; But if God forgive them as freely as I do, as I beg he may, this ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In the next place, after mentioning ſome of the particular Scriptures, from which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſpoke; I am engaged in my heart to leave a few Reaſons &amp; Conſiderations to prove there is a God, without making uſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to convince Atheiſts; many of which I have met with both beyond Sea and here: and theſe Conſiderations may be of uſe to ſome who may meet with ſuch ſpirits, as well as I have done.</p>
            <p>Now the way to prove that, without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by bare Natural Reaſons, is as followeth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider that all things that are, muſt be conſidered under theſe four heads. As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such things as have only a being, and no more; as the Earth, Air, Water, and the Sky, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such things as have being and life, but not ſence; as Herbs, Trees, Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such things that have being, life and ſence, and no more; as all Beaſts, Birds and Fiſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Such things that have being, life, ſence and reaſon; as Men and Women.</p>
            <p>Now under theſe Four is conſidered all the World: and if ſo, let us reaſon from all, and uſe but Reaſon truly, and you muſt confeſs, There muſt be a Power above each, as the only Cauſe of all; and that none of each is the cauſe of it ſelf, nor the cauſe of each other; and that you will ſee if you conſider theſe things.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:38218:74"/>
            <p>Firſt, That which hath only a bare being, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Author and Cauſer of the reſt, and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every Effect is anſwerable and like the Cauſe; but here they are not alike, but differ in their very nature: for one hath a bare being; the reſt have being and life; or, being, life and ſence; or, being, life, ſence and reaſon. Now for the Effect to be ſo differing from its Cauſe in Nature, is contrary to Reaſon and Nature. For in all Cauſes there muſt be a unity between the Cauſe, and the thing or things cauſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is againſt Nature, for any Cauſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to cauſe or produce any Effect, to be a Lord over it ſelf. Now that which hath a being and life, is above that which hath a bare being; and that which hath being, life, ſence and reaſon, is made higher than either, and that is the creature Man, unto whom all theſe three former are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and he a Lord over each.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is a maxim, That <hi>Bodies of themſelves have no movings.</hi> Now where there is no more in a thing than a bare being, it's but a bare body, and its motion is from the power of Life elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; As for example, in a Clock, it cannot move without weights; and theſe weights, that have alſo a bare being or body, they muſt have a hand to put them on: and ſo all bodies that are bare beings, in their motions ſtill muſt relate to a power and life elſewhere. Now without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there can be no propagation; ſo that a bare
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:38218:74"/>being, which is a body without life, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſence and life, much leſs life, ſence and reaſon.</p>
            <p>And now that which hath not only being, but life, that, or them, cannot be the chief original Cauſe, and that from theſe Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which is the firſt Cauſe can ſubſiſt of it ſelf, without that which it doth produce; But Graſs, Herbs, and Trees or Plants cannot ſubſiſt, though they have being and life, without that which hath a bare being and no life, as the Earth, Air, Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That which hath a bare being gives daily ſtrength and life to this that hath being and life; Now had that begun it ſelf, it would have had power to maintain it ſelf without that help.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Graſs, Herbs, Trees, &amp;c. were not the Beginners, but had a beginning, you may ſee clear; If you ſee the nature of one, you may ſee the nature of all: As thus; Is there a branch? it leads thee to the body from whence it came, and from the body of the Tree thou art led to the root, though it be within the ground; and from the root you are led to mind the kernel that fell to the ground from another Tree, &amp;c. as the Cauſe of that Root; If no Kernel, no Root; if no Root, no Body; if no Body, no Branch: And then conſider from whence came that Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; and go backward, and what was it before it was a Tree? It was a Kernel; and a Kernel cannot be without a Tree: And then how came
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:38218:75"/>the firſt Tree? So there muſt be another Cauſe beſides themſelves, to be their Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now as to that, or them, that have being, life and ſence, That, or they, cannot be the Cauſe of other things, for the grounds firſt laid down: As to prove that which hath a bare being could not be the Cauſe, conſider thoſe grounds, and that will alſo prove this, I mean the firſt of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And now that they are not the Cauſe of themſelves you will clearly ſee, if you minde.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Had thoſe been the firſt Cauſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they would have power to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not ſuffer themſelves to be ſlaves and ſervants to that or them, that for power or ſtrength are inferiour to them; as Man is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Beaſts for ſtrength and power, yet is as Lord and Maſter over them, which muſt be from a power above, that doth ſubject the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the weaker, and that is God.</p>
            <p>2dly. If ever they had power to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they have it ſtill, and if ſtill, why do they not ſtill do it? what needs there to be pairs or couples carried from place to place for genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And beſides, do in this as you did by the Herbs and Plants, &amp;c. go backward, and ſee what or who was the Cauſe of the firſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That which had being, life, ſence and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (to wit) <hi>Man,</hi> was not the chief Author and Cauſe of the other Three, is clear from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon firſt laid down, in relation to that which hath but a bare being, in that there is and muſt be a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:38218:75"/>congruity and likeneſs between the Cauſe and it ſelf, but here is none. Beſides,</p>
            <p>If Man be the Cauſe of that which hath only a bare being, and that which had being, and life, and ſence, why doth he not do the like? and why doth he ſometimes periſh for want? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And that he alſo was not the firſt Cauſe of himſelf, will appear from theſe Grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If he had made himſelf, he would have had power to have kept himſelf from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made: for that power that hath ability to make, hath power to preſerve and keep it ſelf from being unmade, or diſſolved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He would make men when he had a mind, if this were ſo. No Men and Woman that have a mind to have Children, would be without them; And when they would have a Son, they would not have a Daughter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They would not have had defects &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but would have been all compleat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weakneſs and ſickneſs; and the longer they had been imployed, the more compleat they would have been.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They would have known themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brought forth: for in making, always know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goes with power, and power with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and then before 'tis, it is known: but the contrary is ſeen daily.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is ſomething in Man, that ſhews there is ſomething above him. Conſider what is the chiefeſt part in man, or of men; it is his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:38218:76"/>Mind, that is above all the reſt in him; his Mind runs out to varieties, and goes up to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and to the furtheſt part of the World, and yet ſits at home in the body; and this <hi>Mind</hi> of man that is above all other parts of man, and knows all, yet it doth not know it ſelf, ſo it's only knowable to ſomething above it; and there is nothing above it in man; therefore that above it is a power beyond it, and that is God. Beſides, the whole man cannot ſatisfie the mind, nor the mind, as the mind, cannot ſatisfie it ſelf, but it muſt be ſomething beſides it, and beyond it, and above it, that is better and higher, and that is God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Many of the Reaſons which were expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before in relation to the other three, if mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will prove this, That man is not the chief Cauſe or firſt Original of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Reaſons from each particular there are and may be Reaſons drawn from all together, to prove that they are not their own Cauſe, nor the firſt and chief Original Cauſe of each other; but it muſt be from a higher, above all, before all, who is the Original Cauſe and Maker of all, and each; and the Conſiderations that will clearly prove it are theſe:
<list>
                  <item>1. The admirable Congruity and Harmony that is between thoſe varieties of bodies; and though very different each from other, yet agree; which cannot be from themſelves, but from ſomething above them.</item>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:38218:76"/>
                  <item>2. The admirable ſubmiſſion each to other, both in power and property, the greater to the leſſer, the higher to the lower; which cannot be from themſelves, but ſomething that is not them, but above and beyond them, and that is God.</item>
                  <item>3. The unexpreſſible ſubſiſtence each by other, and each from other, and ſo each conſidered in ſelf, which in ſuch contrary natures and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of properties could not naturally do it, were there not ſomething that is ſupernatural above all, and that is God.</item>
                  <item>4. A fourth Conſideration is upon the account of the furtheſt end of the leaſt and loweſt, and the ultimate end of the higheſt and chief.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>From all which rightly minded and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you muſt conclude, ſome power before all, and above all, as the Cauſe and chief Lord over all, and that is God.</p>
            <p>Let us go over theſe Four a little larger in way of Contemplation, As</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the Congruity and ſweet Harmony in thoſe varieties of Bodies. If you look upward you will ſee their infinit movings different, and yet not troubled each at other, nor to each other. If you look downwards you ſee the Sea continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally moving above the Earth, and yet not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing there its bounds, but abides as two eſpouſed each to other. We alſo behold all the Creatures of different kinds and properties; and yet how do they concur and agree together! the tame
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:38218:77"/>ones abide in flocks among men for their uſe the wild ones that have ſtrength to deſtroy men they abide in Deſarts, as if they were agreed ſo to do. Sure this muſt be from a power beyond and above all theſe. And now go to Man, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Man, that is an Abridgment of the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe, a Body fit for all ſorts of movings, and a Soul without removing, makes the Body move which way it pleaſes, and by Reaſon guides and governs all in ſuch an admirable Congruity and Harmony, that it's clear that ſomething above all, muſt thus guide, lead and order all, and that is God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider the Strength and admirable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion each to other, though of great difference both in power and property, yet all acting as if each were ſervant to the reſt; the Heavens ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively ſerve the Earth, and the Earth the Herbs, Plants and Graſs, and theſe ſerve the Cattel, and the Cattel ſerve Man, and Man ſerves the Ground by tilling and the Cattel by looking and providing for them: O the ſtrong reciprocal ſubmiſſion and ſervitude! this muſt be from a power beyond and above all, and that is God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The unexpreſſible Subſiſtence. You ſee the Seas about the Earth, which ſeems continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to threaten the Earth, and yet keep within their bounds; the Earth heavy and maſſie, and yet notwithſtanding ſetled, or rather hangs in the Air: The Winter ſeems to deſtroy the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:38218:77"/>Herbs, &amp;c. the Summer again revives them; the Beaſts ſtronger than Men, and able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, and would do ſo, did not a higher power keep them in; and yet they ſubmit, and all ſubſiſt together: O this muſt be from a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er above all, and that is God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider the furtheſt end of the leaſt, and the ultimate end of the chief; What is or can be leſs than a bare being; as Earth, Air, Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have only a bare being: Now what is next to that but a not-being, and that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; now this is a mixim, <hi>That between ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and nothing, let it be never ſo ſmall, yet there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s an infinit ſpace; And nothing but an infinit Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer can bring ſomething out of nothing.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being, <hi>no being</hi> cannot cauſe <hi>a being,</hi> but it muſt be from another cauſe. Now go to the higheſt above Being, is Life, and above that is Life and Sence, and above that is Life, Sence and Reaſon, and that's in Man, &amp;c. So he is the Chief. And what is chief in him? it is his mind and underſtanding, by which he knows all that is to be known; it can go up to Heaven and judge what's there; and to the furtheſt parts of the World, and to all parts at once, and yet ſit at home in the Body; this is the higheſt of all four: Yet this Mind, ſo high, ſo noble, knowing all things, yet cannot know it ſelf: If ſo, there muſt needs be ſomething above that's more chief, more noble, to order and guide, and that is God.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. In anſwer to the firſt Queſtion, as to the buſineſs of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> 'tis clear,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:38218:79"/>that after the Conſecration by the Prieſt it's ſtill bread; And you will ſee it, if you mind what is the Ground of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> judging it otherwiſe: The miſtake is from this word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26, &amp;c. <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Now ſay they, <hi>Chriſt ſaid ſo, and he cannot lie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In anſwer to that we ſay ſo too. But you muſt mind how that word <hi>[this is]</hi> is in Scripture taken: it's taken two wayes,
<list>
                        <item>1. It's taken Really, as in <hi>John</hi> 20.31. <hi>This Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> that is, Chriſt is really <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. It is taken Repreſentatively, repreſenting a thing, and is not really the thing, though the word, <hi>this is,</hi> be there uſed; as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>The ſeven Stars are the Angels of the ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the ſeven Candleſticks are the ſeven Churches.</hi> Now none will ſay, becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot lie, that the Churches <hi>be Candleſticks, &amp;c.</hi> But ſee yet more clearly, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>And they did all drink of that Spiritual Rock; and that</hi> (or this) <hi>Rock was Christ.</hi> Now none will be ſo fooliſh as to affirm, that Chriſt was <hi>a Rock of Stone.</hi> So here, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> that is, it doth really repreſent my Body.

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. In anſwer to the ſecond Queſtion, how to prove Chriſt to be come in anſwer to the <hi>Jews</hi> Objection. Much may be ſaid both from Scripture and Reaſon, too large for me to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert; therefore I ſhall onely mention one ground from the 9th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> beginning at the 24 <hi>ver.</hi> to the end of the <hi>chap.</hi> It being that which I never could ſee either here or beyond Sea by any <hi>Jew</hi> anſwered. There the Angel tels <hi>Daniel</hi> the ſet time of Chriſt's coming and dying, and tells him, <hi>It's ſeventy weeks from the day that the Command went out to rebuild the Temple.</hi> Now that day <hi>Daniel</hi> knew, and from that very day to Chriſt, or the Meſſias death, as it is there expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is to be <hi>ſeventy weeks;</hi> ſeven weeks, and ſixty two weeks, and the week in which he dyed; ſixty two, and ſeven, and one week, make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty

               </gap>s pretended, relates to my former Liberty, and my preſent Impriſonment; For before I was impriſoned, that was (as ſome ſaid) the ground of their Jealouſy, In that ſo many were impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet I, that was ſo notoriouſly known, ſhould be at liberty; Though it was well known I was a Priſoner in the <hi>Marſhal-Generals</hi> houſe, I got out only upon 1000 <hi>l.</hi> bond to appear when ſent for.

            <p>And now when I was taken out of my bed the twentieth day of <hi>August</hi> 1663, and carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Secretary, Sir <hi>Henry Bennet,</hi> who would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dmit me to ſpeak but little for my ſelf, but ſent me to this place; [And when I told him I muſt ſtarve if he ſent me thither, having no means to keep me; he did aſſure me that the King did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Maintenance for all &amp; each Priſoner; though
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:38218:85"/>to this day, which is twenty five weeks, I have not had one bit of bread or drop of drink allowed me] And had it not been for the goodneſs of God, and ſome few Friends, I muſt have ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Now after I had been here about ſeven weeks, I was ſent for by the King, upon the earneſt requeſt of a Kinſman of mine; and when the King heard my name, he remembred that he was told, his Father had left ſomething of his <hi>Will</hi> with me: ſo ſent for me as I ſaid, &amp; a Guard of Muſquetiers carried me to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long time of ſtaying, I was carried before the King, who had my Articles (as I judge) in writing; after a little mentioning of them, he asked me, <hi>If I had not ſome Meſſage from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> I anſwered, I had. So he cauſed all there to withdraw; and then I begged pardon of his Majeſty that I might either not ſpeak any thing, or to have liberty to ſpeak all; for, ſaid I, If I ſpeak all, it may offend ſome; and if I ſpeak not all, I ſhall offend my own Conſcience. So the King very freely told me, <hi>I had liberty to ſpeak all.</hi> I then did, and I bleſs God my memory did not fail me, but I ſpake all and each particular as I received it; His Majeſty was ſo far from taking it ill, that he did kindly imbrace it, and told me <hi>Had not Parliaments bound up his hands, he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his Father's Will in theſe things before now</hi> and ſaid, <hi>he hoped to do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what the particulars were, I had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor now, liberty to declare to others, But I
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:38218:86"/>hope it will be by his Majeſty; for there is not any man living, let him be of what perſwaſion he will, but would have good thoughts of the old King for it; and good thoughts of his Majeſty for accepting of it; unleſs they be ſuch that will believe nothing: for if it were the laſt word I ſhould ſpeak, [It was that which did ſo much tend to the good of the Nation in general, and to all that fear God in particular, that if the beſt and wiſeſt men in the Nation ſhould have liberty to have drawn up their deſires in general heads for good to this Land, they could not have deſired better: Although I am for this, as I have for all things elſe, been cenſured and condemned, ſome affirming that I had ſaid ſomething to the King, that was againſt the Intereſt of all Gods People; A thing which I had rather die than do.

            <p>I Having a little longer time, cannot but add a word to anſwer ſome Friends who ſeem trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the report of my being to be ſent beyond Sea, and the rather, in ſeeing my willingneſs: Now I cannot but ſay, that if they ſhould ſend me away to any cloſe Impriſonment, I had (if God ſee it good) rather they would put me to death here, being not in a capacity to help my ſelf: But ſhould God move their hearts to ſend me to any forreign place where I might do any thing to get bread, and live, enjoying God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, though in a Wilderneſs, I ſhould much more rejoyce to imbrace it, than to live here: My Grounds are,</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſee an impoſſibility to reconcile or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie theſe Spirits that God hath ſuffered to be incenſed againſt me, and raiſed theſe Reports of me: for although I was and am as innocent as the childe unborn from wronging or betraying
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:38218:87"/>any man; and I have by my ſelf and friends, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to ſatisfie all I can come near, yet all comes to nothing, but they that firſt begun it do ſtill foment it: The ſence, that not only I, but God's Name ſuffers by it, with the ſence of their unheard-of-Evil, makes me willing to be where I may rather mourn away my dayes in private, where I may not ſee and hear thoſe Reproaches, than to bear the heart-breakings, under the daily hearing of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It was formerly, but much more now, the deſire of my heart, to do ſome ſervice for God, and bring honour to his Truth and Name, by life or death: but theſe ſort of people have, and do ſo daily revile me, &amp; preſent all I do to be wicked, that whatever I ſay, or do, or ſuffer, it's turned to my Reproach, and the diſhonour of Truth; the ſence of which makes me willing to reſt in ſilence, and rather to live and die in ſecret, than to be publick; for ſo long as I am, I ſee I am not only the object of their reproach, but an occaſion of their ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. I am ſenſible, as the caſe ſtands, that if I were at liberty, let me walk never ſo carefully, yet it would not be long before I ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned again; for there is ſuch an evil ſpirit in ſome, that to ſave themſelves, they value it not to betray the Innocent; And I have now freſh reaſon to ſay ſo, for it's plainly ſeen and found out, that ſome who were, and ſtill are, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to incenſe Friends againſt me, as being
